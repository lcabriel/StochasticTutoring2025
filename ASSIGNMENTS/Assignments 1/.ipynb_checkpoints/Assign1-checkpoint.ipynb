However this wheel has also a particular property. At each iteration of the system there is a probability of $10\\%$ that the external wheel of links change its verse from counter clockwise to clockwise and viceversa (NOTE: So there are two possible transition matrix for the system). \n"

The probabilities can be choose on your own and it's possible to differentiate $\\lambda_{12}$ for the two directions. The class must have a method that allows the user to insert a initial probability distribution and number of iteration and to have in return the probability distribution after that number of iterations. The implementation can be made with either a direct computation (Exercise 1, Lecture 1) or a simulations system (Exercise 4, Lecture 1)"
