# Assignments

In this directory you will find all the assignments. 

Completing the assignments is a requirement for taking the exam. We will give you new assignments every week. You need to hand them in before the next tutoring session or, as we will let you know, by the next assignment deadline.

Assignments will also be graded.

Please submit your assignments to my institutional email address: lorenzo.cabriel@studenti.units.it.

## Assignment rules:

About the works you are going to submit please take notice of these simple rules:

- **Comments and descriptions**: the most important thing that we ask you are the comments in your code. We need to be able to understand your reasoning and, where needed, your choice in the code. The best thing that I can advise you is also to put some general description for classes and methods moreover some comments at the start of the exercise explaining us the general idea and workflow of your code.
- **Understandability over optimality**: in this course we will not look at your code optimization but only at the quality of the method you have implemented. Obviously, the code have to function properly and produce results in compatible times (max. 10 minutes where not specified differently). Moreover, a clearer implementation will allow us to understand better your code!
- **EXTRAS**: in some exercises in addition to the request you will find an "EXTRA" section. This is a further non mandatory request on the exercise that can give you some extra points but it would not influence negatively on the general grade of the assignments.

On the other hand we will try to be as clear as possible on your grades so if you have some questions or need some clarification about a grade please write to the email address above. Similarly, if you have some doubts or problems about the assignments or a specific exercise please feel free to write.
