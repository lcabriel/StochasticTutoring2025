    "We have seen in class how we are able to produce stochastic simulations using a variant of the Maruyama algorithm. In this tough assignment I will ask you to do something more. In fact the Maruyama alg. is used to simulate the $dW$ part of the stochastic differential equation but this noise (known as **white gaussian noise** or simply **white noise**) is not the only possible one. \n",
    "For this problem we will have a noise known as **white shot noise**. The noise acts as an impulsive force with a stochastic intensity capped by a certain parameter $\\alpha$. Moreover the occurance of this events is also stochastic and the time for the next event follow an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$. Graphically is something like this:"
