According to the SIR, during an epidemy, all the population can be categorized in three classes: Susceptible, Infect, Removed. At each time instant we have that a person can pass from a class to another with a certain probability. The problem is that this probability is not fixed in time but depends on how many subjects there are for each category (es. the infection of a subsceptible is proportionaly frequent to the number of infects).\n",

To compute the matrix we will performed a simulation with 1000 Agents that form the population that will evolve. This method allows us to consider a different initial probability distribution for the population and for our simulation. \n",

Let's suppose for example that the object $A$ is in state $0$ and the $B$ is in state $1$. The transition rate for $A$ from 0 to 1 will be equal to 0.1 while the rate from 0 to 2 will be $1.0$. "
